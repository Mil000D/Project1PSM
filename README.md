# Taylor Series Approximation for Computing sin(x)

## Program Description
This repository contains a program that utilizes Taylor series approximation to compute the value of sin(x) for a given value of x.
The program aims to provide an accurate estimation of the sine function using a finite number of terms from its Taylor series.

## Usage
1. Run the program and provide the value of x for which you want to compute sin(x).
2. Specify the number of derivatives to be used from the Taylor series approximation.
3. The program will calculate and display the approximated value of sin(x) based on the provided input.
